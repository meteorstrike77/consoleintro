        <div class = "container" id = "firstdiv">
            <p>A console is a component of a website that is accessed by right clicking, clicking Inspect, and then clicking Console. A console is typically used to test code on a smaller screen instead of testing it on a project itself. To print something on a console, use the console.log function.</p>
            <p>If you open the console of this webpage, you will see many strings of text. Check it out!</p>

        <h1>What is Visual Studio?</h1>
            <div class = "container" id = "seconddiv">
                <p>Visual Studio is an offline IDE (Integrated Development Environment) created by Microsoft.

You can use many different coding languages in Visual Studio, such as HTML, CSS, and JS. It can be used to create amazing webpages and other types of coding.</p>
